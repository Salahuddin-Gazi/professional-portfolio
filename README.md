# **About Me**

Hi,üëèI am Gazi Salahuddin. I always prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter. I am fueled with boundless enthusiasm, easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations. I‚Äôm a passionate, expressive spirit with a natural ability to prosper and inspire. I am not willing just to satisfy myself with ideas. Instead, I have the utmost impulsive resonance to act on them.

I decided that it would be a fun challenge to try designing and building full-stack web projects. I mainly work with JavaScript/NodeJS and other JS frameworks, especially with React JS, React Native.

I‚Äôm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills. I like to develop expertise in several areas over the course of my life and career. I have started my early career as System Support Engineer and then shifted to Business Analytics for e.co Bangladesh . And the skills in web development attracted me the most.

In my free time, I enjoy Web Series and TV Series, Gaming CS: GOwith friends. I‚Äôm also a great fan of the Bangladesh Cricket Team.

This year goal: finish reading 20 books along with "The Lean Startup", "The Intelligent Investor" and "How To Make Money In Stocks".
